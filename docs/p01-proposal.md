# Title of your Project: Project Proposal

**TODO**: Edit this file. Your project proposal goes here.

For what to do, see the [`../instructions/`](../instructions/) directory, specifically:

* [Design Brief](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf)
* [Project Proposal Requirements](../instructions/p01-proposal-requirements.md)

## Code name
Give your project a code name, a short, evocative name for efficiently referring to your project. Your code name does not change! Examples: Jazz-4, Rocking Fish, etc.

## Project title
Give your project a concise, interesting title that summarizes the entirety of your project. (Your title can change on subsequent deliverables.)

## Authors
Names of your team members and contact information (UW email addresses).

## Affiliation
INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington

## Date
Autumn 2022

## Abstract
Write a short abstract of three sentences. Your abstract should summarize your entire project, but only the very most important aspects. Here are two examples of how you might structure your abstract: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." and (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...."

## Keywords
3-5 keywords that summarize your project. (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data")

## Introduction
Briefly introduce your project. (About 150 words.)

## Problem Domain
Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. Note: You must include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure. (About 400 words.)

## Research Questions
Present your 3-5 research questions. You should present each research question. For each research question, you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions you would write about 200 words or more if needed.)

## The Dataset
(1) Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research questions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions? (2) Include a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). (3) Include a full citation to each data file, including URL. (4) Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.)

## Expected Implications
Proposal only. Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (About 150 words.)

## Limitations
Proposal only. What limitations might you need to address? Briefly discuss. (About 150 words.)

## Acknowledgements
Is there anyone you would like to thank? A librarian who helped you with your research? A Teaching Assistant? A friend who helped you find your data? Say thank you in this section.

## References
Include your three or more research citations here. Also, include citations to your data files. Please use a standard citation style of your choice. See Citing Sources at the UW Library.
